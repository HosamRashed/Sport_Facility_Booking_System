# MMU Sports Facility Booking System

Welcome to the MMU Sports Facility Booking System repository. This project aims to revolutionize the management and utilization of sports facilities at Multimedia University. The system addresses the current manual process of reserving sports facilities by automating the booking process and providing a mobile application for students to conveniently access and manage their bookings.

## Overview

Managing sports facilities and organizing their utilization at MMU is currently done manually, requiring students to fill out a Google Form for booking requests. The MMU Sports Facility Booking System aims to automate and streamline this process. The system comprises two parts:
- A web application dashboard for administrators and staff to manage facility information, time slots, and statistics.
- A mobile application for students to book facilities, receive announcements, and manage bookings.

## Problem Statement

The existing manual booking process has limitations, including lack of visibility into facility availability, potential for double bookings, and inconvenience for both students and staff. This project aims to address these issues by developing a mobile application that provides a visible timetable of available slots, allowing students to book and manage facilities seamlessly.

## Objectives

- Simplify and automate the MMU sports facility booking process.
- Enhance utilization of sports facilities through an efficient mobile application.
- Implement penalties for misuse of the booking process and minimize wasted facility time.
- Provide modules for facility management and booking to administrators and students.
- Raise awareness among students about MMU's sports facilities.

## Goals

- Develop a mobile application for sports facility bookings, benefiting both students and administrators.
- Enhance the efficiency and accuracy of facility booking and utilization.

## Project Scope

The project includes the development of a mobile application compatible with iOS and Android devices. It encompasses a booking module for students to view, book, and edit sports facility bookings, and a management module for administrators to manage, update, and track facility usage.

## Technologies Used

For the **web application**, the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) was utilized to ensure a robust and dynamic interface.

For the **mobile application**, React Native was employed for front-end development, while Node.js and Express were used to establish seamless communication between the front-end and backend components.
